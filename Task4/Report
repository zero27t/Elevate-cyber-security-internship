How Firewalls Work
Packet Inspection: Firewalls examine packet headers for details such as source and destination IP address, port number, and protocol type (TCP, UDP, etc.).
Rule Evaluation: Each packet’s information is compared against predefined filtering rules (Access Control Lists). These rules specify what types of traffic are permitted or denied.
Access Control Decision: If a match is found for an allowed rule, the packet passes through the firewall; if it matches a blocked rule, the firewall denies it.
Default Action: If a packet does not match any rules, the firewall applies a default behavior (commonly blocking the packet for added security).
Logging/Monitoring: Most firewalls log their decisions and generate alerts for suspicious activity, helping administrators audit and detect threats.
